# Professional README Generator

## Description

I create this application to learn about Node.js. The basic code for this app was provided by a Bootcamp course. I create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.
I learn:  
    - how to use Node.js.  
    - how to use the inquirer package.   
    - How to use the module fs to read and write files.
    - How to create license badges. 
    - How to use Node package manager (npm) to borrow packages.
